# Unity week 4:

This project was done as part of the "Computer Game Development" course at Ariel University.

You can see the assignment at the following link: https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5781/blob/master/04-unity-triggers/homework.pdf

The aim of the project was to get to know with unity prefabs, collisions, and triggers.

## Q3

We had to build a game with two players. The two players move with different keys on the keyboard and they both can shoot. The purpose of the player is to hit the enemy with 3 shots. The first to hit the enemy with 3 shots wins the game.
